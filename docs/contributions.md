Contributions are greatly appreciated! 

They should be made through pull requests to this repository. 

Guidelines are as follows:
1. Anything user facing should be easy and intuitive to use. It should be as simple as, once you show it to someone once, they can just use it. Things should behave as expected
2. There should be tests written for any function you write. I would love 100% coverage. I would also so totally accept contributions of tests. I have not yet written tests for some of my functions.
3. Please be relatively respectful of people - anyone involved in this project is a volunteer. They are not actually REQUIRED to merge anything you write. I most likely will merge pull requests, assuming they are good additions to the project, but please be aware that I at any time can decide that your pull request will not be merged upstream.
4. Code are not the only valuable contributions! Even if you do not know how to code, writing more documentation, or making videos on the topic are great!
