Any forks made, or any projects using my code, need to be aware of the license im using. The Reciprocal Public License requires a few things from you, namely that you publish any changes you make to my code. You must make the code for whatever you are using my project for available to the open source community at large. Please read the license all the way through, especially if you are intending on using this in a business setting, as this may be a dealbreaker for you. I hope it is not, but I deem using a license like this necessary to make sure projects I make do not later become commercialized in an anti-consumer fashion. I own a lot of devices which try their best to limit the things I do with them, for example, my iPhone. I hate that. Don't do that. Publish code you write, and wish for other people to extract as much joy from it as you have.
